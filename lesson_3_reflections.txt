When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When working in a team or working from several computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because I don't let my underage son drive my car :). He could make a big mess. Similarly (to an extent), why would I want GitHub to automatically update my local repo whenever there's an update online. Maybe I'm making my own changes locally and when I'm ready I can pull the changes from the remote repo (which could've been done by me and pushed from another computer or by someone else if working on a team). So automatically pulling changes could create instant conflicts and whatnot before my local changes are ready for a commit. It just doesn't seem right. That's like using GitHub like a backup service, which is a valid use in some cases I guess, but it's not the general idea.
