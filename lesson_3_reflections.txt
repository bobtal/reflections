When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When working in a team or working from several computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because I don't let my underage son drive my car :). He could make a big mess. Similarly (to an extent), why would I want GitHub to automatically update my local repo whenever there's an update online. Maybe I'm making my own changes locally and when I'm ready I can pull the changes from the remote repo (which could've been done by me and pushed from another computer or by someone else if working on a team). So automatically pulling changes could create instant conflicts and whatnot before my local changes are ready for a commit. It just doesn't seem right. That's like using GitHub like a backup service, which is a valid use in some cases I guess, but it's not the general idea.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork means cloning a repository from GitHub on GitHub, from one user's account to another (logged in user's) account. Cloning is just cloning a repository from anywhere (including GitHub) to a local computer. And branching is different from the first two concepts, it's creating a new branch within a repository. It's a separate branch where some new work could be done, without affecting the code on the original branch from which the new branch was created (usually master).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You can work offline knowing the last state of the remote. Though you should andticipate more recent commits on the remote if working on a team. In general, it's the same benefit of having the whole web stored locally so in case you have to go offline you still have access to a snapshot of the whole web from a few hours ago (or maybe more reasonable from a few selected websites you visit regularly). It's just benefitial, can't thnik of a more specific way to describe it.
